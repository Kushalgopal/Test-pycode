## Code Conversion from JPEG to TIF
```python
from PIL import Image
from osgeo import gdal

# Open the input JPEG image and extract the geo-coordinates
with Image.open('input.jpg') as img:
    lat, lon = img.info['lat'], img.info['lon']
    # Alternatively, you can extract the geo-coordinates using the Exif tags

# Open the input JPEG image using GDAL
src_ds = gdal.Open('input.jpg')

# Create the output TIFF image using GDAL
driver = gdal.GetDriverByName('GTiff')
dst_ds = driver.Create('output.tif', src_ds.RasterXSize, src_ds.RasterYSize, src_ds.RasterCount, src_ds.GetRasterBand(1).DataType)

# Set the geo-coordinates of the output TIFF image
dst_ds.SetGeoTransform(src_ds.GetGeoTransform())
dst_ds.SetProjection(src_ds.GetProjection())

# Copy the data from the input JPEG image to the output TIFF image
for i in range(1, src_ds.RasterCount + 1):
    band = src_ds.GetRasterBand(i)
    dst_band = dst_ds.GetRasterBand(i)
    dst_band.WriteArray(band.ReadAsArray())

# Close the input and output files
src_ds = None
dst_ds = None

```
**NOTE:**
This code opens the input JPEG image using the PIL library and extracts the geo-coordinates. It then opens the same image again using the GDAL library and creates an output TIFF image using the same dimensions and data type as the input image. The geo-coordinates of the output image are set to be the same as the input image using the SetGeoTransform() and SetProjection() methods. Finally, the data is copied from the input image to the output image band by band using a loop.

Note that the above code assumes that the input JPEG image has geo-coordinates embedded in the image metadata. If this is not the case, you may need to extract the geo-coordinates from other sources, such as a separate metadata file. Additionally, you may need to adjust the code to handle other aspects of the image, such as the color profile or compression settings, depending on your specific use case.
